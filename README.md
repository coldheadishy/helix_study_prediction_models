# HELIX Study Prediction Models for Neurological Behaviour in Infants

Building prediction models using variants of LASSO for prenatal outcomes, specifically neurological behavior of children aged 6-11 who participated in the HELIX study. HELIX used a multilevel study design with the entire study population totaling 31,472 motherâ€“child pairs, recruited during pregnancy, in the six existing cohorts. Specifically focusing on a subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs who enrolled into the study during pregnancy. Statistical analysis included cleaning data using complete-case analysis, filtering out extraneous
covariates using LASSO and k-fold cross validation, and using the results from LASSO and group LASSO methods to build multiple models. You can read about the HELIX study here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6144482/

This is a preview of the project, it is non-excutable in this form, just a few peaks at some code chunks. Much of the analysis has also been excluded. This is because it was a project for school and I need to comply with university policies. Of course, there is also perhaps not enough context given here to fully grasp what is being done. I apologize for that, I hope that some of the documentation at least fills in a few of the details.

If you wish to see this project in full please contact me and state intent (ie. you are an employer/recruiter) and I can share the report in full with you privately.
